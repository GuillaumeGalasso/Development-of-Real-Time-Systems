# Development-of-Real-Time-Systems

A 5 weeks MOOC about Real Time systems based on FreeRTOS kernel from EIT Digital through [**Coursera**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/real-time-systems).

Date: August - September 2017

The course teaches how to plan real-time systems in theory using established mathematical proofs and how to implement them in practice by using the most common scheduling methods.
We also learn and how to program the system in the C language using the FreeRTOS real-time kernel.

Course achieved with a score of % (**[Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/records/QGY27S7HR56A)** available)
